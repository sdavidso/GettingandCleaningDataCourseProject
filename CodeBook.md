###Introduction
This table tidies the data given by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set. In this table we find the average of every mean and standard deviation measured features with respect to every person and activity performed. This is achieved by gathering every data point from the trial and test sections and then finding the averages of the relevant features we selected, separated by every person and activity. The files for activity names, name identifiers, and measurement data are combined to make a neat table. 

###Variables

####ID

This is the identifier of the person who is being measured, given by "subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt"

####Activity

This gives the description of the activity being measured. This is found by connecting the activity labels given with the activity names.

####Measurement features

These variables contain the final averages calculated from the mean and standard deviation values found with the measured features as described from the Human Activity Recognition source

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
